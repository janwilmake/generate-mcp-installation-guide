What are the top 50 contenders to be the most popular clients to use LLMs these days? For each of them, find out the available metrics to determine the amount of use.

Create an estimation for these 50 to get the top 25 most used LLM clients.
For each of them, find out:

- if it supports MCP
- if custom MCPs can be added
- if they support MCPs with OAuth
- if there's a deep link to add a custom MCP
- if so, the deep link URL for installing a custom MCP (one click install)

Please use Search MCP first to find contenders and rank them. then do a pro task for each client of the top 25. in your output_schema ensure to be super clear on the required info using the property description fields

NB: I am not interested in their OWN MCP or in their own oauth or other types of deep links. I'm interested in whether they are an MCP supported client where people can install any MCP and if that has oauth and a deep link to install an MCP.
