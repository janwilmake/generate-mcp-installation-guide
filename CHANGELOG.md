- ✅ icons are low-quality, should be sharper (maybe use different api?)
- ✅ Find best intermediate solution to giving icons: https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1982034203211358495
- ✅ It looks a bit spammy/sketchy. I think consistency in the look and feel across open-source projects with our name on it is important. remove blue bg
- ✅ align installthismcp color-schema and add disclaimer 'what is installthismcp'?
- ✅ We can try to retrieve the JSON from GET and IF present, use that for icons, and title. also if present show the websiteUrl and version, and have a button to expand instructions.

# TODO

- Keep track of which URLs get most traffic. This is potentially a nice way to start a registry.
- Use parallel to do MCP Client research every week automatically, such that this repo can be maintained with lower overhead.
